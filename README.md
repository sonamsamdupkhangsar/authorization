# My Customization of Spring Authorization Server
This is my customization of the Spring Authorization Server which is OAuth2.1 and OpenID Connect 1.0 implementation.

## Purpose
I am working on using OAuth2 workflow authorization and OIDC for authentication in application.  The goal is to use Refresh Token/Access Token to authorize requests to application instead of building my own custom implementation.

The goal is to use this authorization server with other microservices.
